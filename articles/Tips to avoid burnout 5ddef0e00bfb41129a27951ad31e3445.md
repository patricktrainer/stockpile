> Burn out happens when - the company or team is under duress, imagine running a manufacturing software system and your factory lines are down. Yes, that gets intense and you can have a burn out if problem requires rehauling the system (takes 6 months say). Or the company is on the brink of collapse and you're one of the 3 engineers holding it together. But, that's not because of the reasons listed here. In fact, writing such an article is dismissive because it distracts the discussion on what really leads to burn out.

I wouldn't say that's the case at all.

The first time I struggled with burnout was because the organisation I worked within was built in such a way that the rank and file are irrelevant and take some sort of grim pleasure in being low status.

In that situation there doesn't have to be any crisis or external pressure. You can just be stuck in a bureaucracy with a drone manager that makes your working day pointless.

The further I get away from that, the happier I am.

IME the company, your life, whatever, can be falling apart as long as you know that those around you are actually playing the same game as you and care about the outcome.
