A commonly asked question is what picture cord knot works best for hanging a picture frame? To answer this we first have to ask what are the desirable features of a picture cord knot?

The following are some desirable features of a picture knot –

- Won’t untie (self tightening)
- Won’t sag (so you can hang several pictures simultaneously in a line)
- Will look neat and tidy (for a professional finish)
- Won’t fray at the ends

Sagging can be minimised by using low stretch picture cord, you can then decide on the choice of knot.

One knot that meets the above criteria can be achieved as follows –

1. Attach D-Rings to back of frame (1/3 way down each side)
2. Cut cord to 3 x the width of the frame and feed cord through D-Rings as shown below –

6. Feed the right hand end through the loop that you just created as shown below. Pull either ends of the cord away from each other until knot tightens, change directions of pulling by 180 and pull again in opposite direction to tighten –

8. Tie a few ‘granny knot’ L over R, then R over L to secure the underlying knot –

11. The finished cord/knot combination should have a nice clean looking finish, and should provide a tight and secure cord to hang the picture via a picture hook on the wall –
