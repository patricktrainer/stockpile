Peter Bailis, founder and CEO of Sisu

Peter Bailis can’t resist dropping more than a dozen f-bombs as he explains how his startup Sisu aims to upend traditional business intelligence and reshape the way companies act on the massive amounts of information—about products, sales, customers, etc.—that they generate and store.

“Data is going to keep getting wider and wider, and if we don’t figure out what to do with it to make it productive for end users, then this whole f–-ing thing is going to collapse,” he says. “It’s a product problem plus a tech problem.”

While an endless number of tools help companies store, sort and visualize their tsunami of data, he says Sisu goes a step further. It doesn’t just let companies track key performance indicators, like customer conversion rates or churn, it aims to show which specific factors are responsible for a change.

“We nail the ‘why,’” he says. “And no one can match our speed or the result quality.”

Bailis, a former Stanford researcher and assistant professor currently on leave, founded Sisu last year, but the so-called operational analytics company is emerging from stealth Wednesday with a $52.5 million Series B round of funding led by NEA, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz and Green Bay Ventures, bringing its total funding to $66.7 million.

The idea that companies want ever more granular ways to understand their business metrics is proven. This year, data analytics and visualization companies Tableau and Looker were scooped up in multibillion dollar acquisitions by Salesforce and Google, respectively. Meanwhile, a slew of startups like [DataRobot](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/09/17/machine-learning-startup-datarobot-raises-206-million/) and H2O are helping companies build predictive models based on their data. Sisu’s product sits between these two areas: It eschews manual analysis of dashboards and reports and isn’t focused on helping predict what could change in the future. Instead, it processes the massive amounts of data related to a given goal (increase conversion rates) and ranks which factors are currently affecting it, effectively telling companies *why* a metric is changing.

The platform launches to general availability Wednesday, but over the course of its beta testing it’s signed on customers like freelance platform Upwork, salad chain Mixt, and phone maker Samsung. Samsung, for example, used Sisu to understand why Galaxy and Galaxy Note upgrades were slowing. Its teams could see which customer segments were upgrading, or not, and that information influenced its marketing plans. As the company rolled out different ad targeting, it could see the effects of changes through Sisu as they occurred. The ability to automatically push updates when new data arrives is one of Sisu’s strengths, according to Bailis.

“I literally think someone should have started this company a while ago,” he says.

In nearly the same breath, he explains away his own bewilderment: It has been a hard problem to solve, a long time in the making, relying on his years of research at Stanford, where he worked on a [project to make AI-powered applications easier to build](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/). Sisu’s platform is built [around his research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00567.pdf) on how to search large amounts of data, quickly, for noteworthy changes. He decided to leave academia when he realized how big a market there was for the kind of product that could notify companies of key data changes.

Sisu customers can, for example, drill down on which factors are affecting a key performance ... [+]

Ben Horowitz, who led his firm’s investments in Sisu’s Series A and B, says that both Bailis’ tech chops and his approach to making machine learning usable, impressed him.

“There are two ways companies are going about the market: They’re either basically building more graphs and pretty pictures, or they’re applying deep learning for predictions,” Horowitz says, “What Sisu built doesn’t look like anything else out there: It just shows you why things are happening.”

Gartner analyst W. Roy Schulte says that the old approach to business intelligence, where analysts check dashboards once a day, has evolved as storing and analyzing data has become more inexpensive and companies can pump out reports in nearly real-time.

“For most operational intelligence systems, the system can proactively sends alerts when a metric passes a certain threshold,” says Schulte. “But you have to drill down into the details yourself to figure out why things changed. The diagnostic aspect is fairly manual.”

What Sisu claims to do, he says, is highlight the root cause of a change.

“What companies want is, ‘Tell me what to do,’” Schulte says.

The name of the company comes from a Finnish concept that roughly translates to tenacity and determination, which Bailis says captures the both the technological hurdle of sorting through massive amounts of data as well as the platform’s objectives.

“It’s like an analyst team that never sleeps, complains or blinks,” he says. “You need a lot of grit to do that.”
