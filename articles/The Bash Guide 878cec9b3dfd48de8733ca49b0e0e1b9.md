# The Bash Guide

Created: Mar 21, 2020 10:12 PM

This guide is an introduction to basic and advanced concepts of the bash shell.

It teaches both newcomers and long-time users the best, safest and most robust ways of writing powerful bash scripts as well as making efficient and speedy interactive use of the shell.

This guide has gone through several iterations and is the result of a severe lack of consistent, clear and reliable language on the topic on the rest of the Internet as well as the public library or book stores.
