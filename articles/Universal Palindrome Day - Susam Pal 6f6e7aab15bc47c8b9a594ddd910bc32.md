There are three popular date formats followed worldwide: big-endian, little-endian, and middle-endian. Here is how today's date looks like in these three formats if the full year is written:

The ISO 8601 standard specifies the big-endian date format. The big-endian format is popular in China, Japan, Canada, etc. The little-endian date format is popular in a huge number of countries including Germany, United Kingdom, India, Italy, etc. The middle-endian date format is primarily popular in the United States.

Today's date is a palindrome in all three date formats. It is *universally palindromic*. Note that we ignore the hyphens or any other delimiters while deciding if a date is palindrome or not. In fact, in general, punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are usually ignored while deciding if a given text is palindrome or not.

If we define *universal palindrome day* to be a day when its date is a palindrome in all three date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MM-YYYY, and MM-DD-YYYY), then today is a universal palindrome day!
